## The stack

For the tech stack I've chosen to keep it simple though powerful. I also made the choice to use as many new technologies as possible to get me out of my comfort zone.

For example:

- I didn't know anything about Cloudflare workers or pages.
- It's the first time I use bun properly as a runtime.
- Hono was a whole new learning experience as well.
